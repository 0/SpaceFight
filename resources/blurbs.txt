WE DID NOT PREPARE A BRIEFING
Snake listen up. It all went down five hours ago.^Heavily armed soldiers occupied Shadow Moses Island,^a remote island off the coast of Alaska.^^>What soldiers?^^Next-Generation Special Forces^led by members of unit FOX-HOUND.^They've presented Washington with a single demand, and they saythat if it^ isn't met, they'll launch a nuclear weapon.^^>A nuclear weapon?^^I'm afraid so. You see, the island is the site of a secret^nuclear weapons disposal facility.^^>FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon?^^Now you understand how serious the situation is.^You'll have two mission objectives.^First, you're to rescue the DARPA^(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)^Chief, Donald Anderson, and the^president of ArmsTech, Kenneth Baker.^They're both being held as hostages.^^>Those are some heavy duty hostages.^^Secondly, you're to investigate whether or not^the terrorists have the ability to launch^a nuclear strike, and stop them if they do.^^Any questions, Snake?^
I like how all the girls music ^is the intro song remixes a million ways ^just like how the guys is just burn my dread.^Also I feel weird getting hit on by junpei.^Oh god, will Ken hit on me too?^totally going to kill that little snotface.^Also it's kind of jarring going from 3d models^animatimg the story to lonely world bg^with character portraits ala visual novels.^It's a pretty different take.^Tartarus is still Grindy fun though.
