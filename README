Spacefuck was written in Python 2.6.6, originally on a Windows environment.  As none of the libraries used were platform dependent, Spacefuck should run on all platforms with a Python release.  It's been tested on Windows XP through to 7, OSX, and whichever linux distribution O uses.

Spacefuck uses pygame 1.91 and the current version of pymunk (2.1.0), which is a python wrapper for Chipmunk, a C based physics library.

Double praises to 0 (https://github.com/0).  He developed a lot more enthusiasm for updating the game than I did once it was released.



I'm looking to implement some new changes within the near future:
--Migration of game settings to configuration file.
--Gravity in planetoid mode.
--More sophisticated AI
--Performance improvements
--Simpler architecture
