Spacefuck was written in Python 2.6.6, originally on a Windows environment. 
As none of the libraries used are platform exclusive, Spacefuck should run on all major platforms with a Python release. 
It's been tested on Windows XP through to 7, OSX, and whichever linux distribution O uses.

Spacefuck shows reasonable performance on most post-2006 hardware. We'll be looking to reduce the performance requirements soon.

Spacefuck uses pygame 1.91 and current version of pymunk (3.0.0), which is a python wrapper for Chipmunk, a C based physics library.

Double praises to 0 (https://github.com/0) for faithfully updating the game and adding new features.
