Spacefuck was written in Python 2.6.6, originally on a Windows environment.  As none of the libraries used were platform dependent, Spacefuck should run on all platforms with a Python release.  It's been tested on Windows XP through to 7, OSX, and whichever linux distribution O uses.

I've had Spacefuck run at a full 60fps on an old AMD Athlon XP 2.5Ghz machine with a Radeon 9600 and ample memory under Windows 7.  This should hopefully be an indication that most people will get suitable performance out of the game.  It's only drawing five images and about a hundred circles on a 800 x 600 window.  It really isn't that demanding.

Spacefuck uses pygame 1.91 and the current version of pymunk (2.1.0), which is a python wrapper for Chipmunk, a C based physics library.

Double praises to 0 (https://github.com/0).  He developed a lot more enthusiasm for updating the game than I did once it was released.
